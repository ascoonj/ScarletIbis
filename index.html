       The Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber), locally known as "flamingo," makes its home in the Caroni Bird Sanctuary in the Caroni Swamp--an area set aside by the government for the protection of these colourful birds. The Caroni Swamp includes fifteen thousand acres of marshland, tidal lagoons, and mangrove trees. Several thousand Scarlet Ibises nest and roost in the sanctuary and are often seen in large numbers during the last two hours of daylight. Larger numbers of Scarlet Ibises can be seen during the breeding season, from April to August. These birds feed mainly on crabs which they seek out on the mud flats exposed at low tide and on the stilt roots of the red mangrove. Boat tours of the Caroni Swamp are available throughout the year. What’s not to like about big, bright red, big-beaked, birds? Nothing, that’s what. And there is no better place to see Eudocimus ruber than deep in the mangroves that make up Caroni Swamp. Just south of Port of Spain on the west coast of Trinidad, the Caroni Swamp is easily accessible and well serviced by tour companies that will take you out into the mangroves safely and efficiently.
       
       But it wasn’t always this way. Hunting of Scarlet Ibis for their feathers as well as drainage of portions of the swamp for rice harvesting was, at one time, putting what is now a major tourist destination in jeopardy. Fortunately, forward-thinkers prevailed, the site is now protected as a Ramsar Wetland, and the hunting of Scarlet Ibis has become a social taboo</p>
